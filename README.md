Using Arduino-type microcontroller with an atmospheric pressure sensor and a Bluetoosh Low Energy module to track elevation above sea level.

## Abstract
Got the idea for this when the family decided to move to the short. This is Japan, so tsunami's are a thing. Figured it would be nice to know your elevation above sea level at all times. Sure, there is an for that, but I wanted something that gives an ambient awareness at all times. After a while you have an mental map of topography.

##Hardware
